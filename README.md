Being fed up with AI-generated spam in youtube search results, I created this list. I'll update it every now and then. Feel free to use it.

YoutubeAIChannels.ahk is the Autohotkey v1 script I use to quickly build the list. It basically copies (when I double-press ctrl) the URL of the link I'm hovering on a youtube page. The link can be a video link or a channel root page link. The script then identifies the user name and the channel name, and then creates 4 lines of ublock filter rules with those. Feel free to use it as well.
